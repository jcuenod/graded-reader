"""
Orders the learning of items based on, at each step, assigning a score to each
unknown item and learning the highest scoring item next before recalculating
the scores all over again with the remaining items.

The score is currently the sum of 1 / 2 ** number_of_items_missing_from_target
for each target in which the item is missing.

Therefore, at each step, it favours a next item that is the only missing item
(or one of only a few missing items) from lots of targets.

The input file should consist of lines of <target> <item> separated by
whitespace.

The output will consist of "learn <item>" and "know <target>" lines.
